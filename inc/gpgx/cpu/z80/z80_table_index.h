 *
 *   TODO:
 *    - If LD A,I or LD A,R is interrupted, P/V flag gets reset, even if IFF2
 *      was set before this instruction
 *    - Ideally, the tiny differences between Z80 types should be supported,
 *      currently known differences:
 *       - LD A,I/R P/V flag reset glitch is fixed on CMOS Z80
 *       - OUT (C),0 outputs 0 on NMOS Z80, $FF on CMOS Z80
 *       - SCF/CCF X/Y flags is ((flags | A) & 0x28) on SGS/SHARP/ZiLOG NMOS Z80,
 *         (flags & A & 0x28) on NEC NMOS Z80, other models unknown.
 *         However, people from the Speccy scene mention that SCF/CCF X/Y results
 *         are inconsistant and may be influenced by I and R registers.
 *      This Z80 emulator assumes a ZiLOG NMOS model.
 *
 *   Additional changes [Eke-Eke]:
 *    - Removed z80_burn function (unused)
 *    - Discarded multi-chip support (unused)
 *    - Fixed cycle counting for FD and DD prefixed instructions
 *    - Fixed behavior of chained FD and DD prefixes (R register should be only incremented by one
 *    - Implemented cycle-accurate INI/IND (needed by SMS emulation)
 *    - Fixed Z80 reset
 *    - Made SZHVC_add & SZHVC_sub tables statically allocated
 *    - Fixed compiler warning when BIG_SWITCH is defined
 *   Changes in 3.9:
 *    - Fixed cycle counts for LD IYL/IXL/IYH/IXH,n [Marshmellow]
 *    - Fixed X/Y flags in CCF/SCF/BIT, ZEXALL is happy now [hap]
 *    - Simplified DAA, renamed MEMPTR (3.8) to WZ, added TODO [hap]
 *    - Fixed IM2 interrupt cycles [eke]
 *   Changes in 3.8 [Miodrag Milanovic]:
 *   - Added MEMPTR register (according to informations provided
 *     by Vladimir Kladov
 *   - BIT n,(HL) now return valid values due to use of MEMPTR
 *   - Fixed BIT 6,(XY+o) undocumented instructions
 *   Changes in 3.7 [Aaron Giles]:
 *   - Changed NMI handling. NMIs are now latched in set_irq_state
 *     but are not taken there. Instead they are taken at the start of the
 *     execute loop.
 *   - Changed IRQ handling. IRQ state is set in set_irq_state but not taken
 *     except during the inner execute loop.
 *   - Removed x86 assembly hacks and obsolete timing loop catchers.
 *   Changes in 3.6:
 *   - Got rid of the code that would inexactly emulate a Z80, i.e. removed
 *     all the #if Z80_EXACT #else branches.
 *   - Removed leading underscores from local register name shortcuts as
 *     this violates the C99 standard.
 *   - Renamed the registers inside the Z80 context to lower case to avoid
 *     ambiguities (shortcuts would have had the same names as the fields
 *     of the structure).
 *   Changes in 3.5:
 *   - Implemented OTIR, INIR, etc. without look-up table for PF flag.
 *     [Ramsoft, Sean Young]
 *   Changes in 3.4:
 *   - Removed Z80-MSX specific code as it's not needed any more.
 *   - Implemented DAA without look-up table [Ramsoft, Sean Young]
 *   Changes in 3.3:
 *   - Fixed undocumented flags XF & YF in the non-asm versions of CP,
 *     and all the 16 bit arithmetic instructions. [Sean Young]
 *   Changes in 3.2:
 *   - Fixed undocumented flags XF & YF of RRCA, and CF and HF of
 *     INI/IND/OUTI/OUTD/INIR/INDR/OTIR/OTDR [Sean Young]
 *   Changes in 3.1:
 *   - removed the REPEAT_AT_ONCE execution of LDIR/CPIR etc. opcodes
 *     for readabilities sake and because the implementation was buggy
 *     (and I was not able to find the difference)
 *   Changes in 3.0:
 *   - 'finished' switch to dynamically overrideable cycle count tables
 *   Changes in 2.9:
 *   - added methods to access and override the cycle count tables
 *   - fixed handling and timing of multiple DD/FD prefixed opcodes
 *   Changes in 2.8:
 *   - OUTI/OUTD/OTIR/OTDR also pre-decrement the B register now.
 *     This was wrong because of a bug fix on the wrong side
 *     (astrocade sound driver).
 *   Changes in 2.7:
 *    - removed z80_vm specific code, it's not needed (and never was).
 *   Changes in 2.6:
 *    - BUSY_LOOP_HACKS needed to call change_pc() earlier, before
 *    checking the opcodes at the new address, because otherwise they
 *    might access the old (wrong or even NULL) banked memory region.
 *    Thanks to Sean Young for finding this nasty bug.
 *   Changes in 2.5:
 *    - Burning cycles always adjusts the ICount by a multiple of 4.
 *    - In REPEAT_AT_ONCE cases the R register wasn't incremented twice
 *    per repetition as it should have been. Those repeated opcodes
 *    could also underflow the ICount.
 *    - Simplified TIME_LOOP_HACKS for BC and added two more for DE + HL
 *    timing loops. I think those hacks weren't endian safe before too.
 *   Changes in 2.4:
 *    - z80_reset zaps the entire context, sets IX and IY to 0xffff(!) and
 *    sets the Z flag. With these changes the Tehkan World Cup driver
 *    _seems_ to work again.
 *   Changes in 2.3:
 *    - External termination of the execution loop calls z80_burn() and
 *    z80_vm_burn() to burn an amount of cycles (R adjustment)
 *    - Shortcuts which burn CPU cycles (BUSY_LOOP_HACKS and TIME_LOOP_HACKS)
 *    now also adjust the R register depending on the skipped opcodes.
 *   Changes in 2.2:
 *    - Fixed bugs in CPL, SCF and CCF instructions flag handling.
 *    - Changed variable EA and ARG16() function to UINT32; this
 *    produces slightly more efficient code.
 *    - The DD/FD XY CB opcodes where XY is 40-7F and Y is not 6/E
 *    are changed to calls to the X6/XE opcodes to reduce object size.
 *    They're hardly ever used so this should not yield a speed penalty.
 *   New in 2.0:
 *    - Optional more exact Z80 emulation (#define Z80_EXACT 1) according
 *    to a detailed description by Sean Young which can be found at:
 *      http://www.msxnet.org/tech/z80-documented.pdf
